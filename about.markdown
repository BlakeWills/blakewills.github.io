![Blake](/assets/img/blake.jpg "Blake")

Hey, I’m Blake. I’m currently working at BJSS as an Azure Consultant, after working for the past few years as an SRE.

I’ve designed cloud infrastructure and networks, built observability and monitoring systems, architected applications, made software run faster and cheaper, and written mobile apps to stop HGVs hitting bridges. Damn bridges.

Overall, I love designing and building things to run in the cloud, at scale.

Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.
